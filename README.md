##Inspiration
Our inspiration is to help out those affect by the recent LA fires to find quality rental properties at an affordable price.

##What it does
A user will input their desired renting needs which will query the rentcast api to get a large list of potential properites. Each of the properties will then be shown on an interactive map with the google maps api. A user can then select a property and get an AI evaluated score on whether the price is good given a variety of factors using groq and its llama3 model by meta.

##How we built it
Built using Flask and python, the rentcast, google maps, and groq apis, along with web tools like css, html, and javascript.

##Challenges we ran into
Ran into issues with dealing with so many api requests.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was our first time using these api and using so many api at the same time, so we are very proud of how we were able to combine them all in such a way.

##What we learned
We learned the importance of planning, this project definetly could've gone smoother with more time spent planning it out.

##What's next for LA Rental Finder
I believe we can fine tune the AI even more, maybe take in even more parameters into our AI so we get an even better result of how good the deal is.
